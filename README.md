# Merlin-Demon-War-Card-Game
XAMX University project challenge

Making this game taught me how to make animations (dealing cards and spells), and how to use one spell animation animations for all the spells and from both the player and enemy direction.
The game has Ice and Fire types for both spells and enemies. So if the type is the same ie. Ice/Ice the spell deals half less damage than what is listed.
There is a spell that has Fire and Ice type, that one deals the same damage no matter the enemy type. And there is a Destruction spell which destroys a player regardless of how much life they have.

I added extra audio on enemy death just for fun.
